### Terms Learned
- ***Data Exfiltration***: Data exfiltration, also known as data extrusion or data exportation, is the unauthorized and covert transfer of data from a computer or network to an external location. It's a form of data theft and a serious cyber security concern, often involving the malicious extraction of sensitive information like PII, financial records, or trade secrets.
  
- ***SOC(Security operation Center)***: A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a centralized team or function within an organization that focuses on monitoring, detecting, analyzing, and responding to cybersecurity threats. It acts as the central command center for an organization's security posture, ensuring its IT infrastructure is protected against cyberattacks.
  
- ***Low Privilege User***: A low-privileged user is a user account with limited permissions, specifically designed to minimize potential damage from security breaches. This principle, known as the principle of least privilege (PoLP), dictates that users should only have access to the resources and data they absolutely need to perform their tasks.
  
- ***Privilege Escalation***: Privilege escalation refers to the act of gaining unauthorized access to a system or application and increasing one's level of access beyond what is normally permitted. Essentially, it's about an attacker exploiting vulnerabilities to move from a lower-level user or process to a higher-level one, potentially gaining administrative privileges. This can be achieved through various methods, including exploiting software vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or social engineering tactics.
