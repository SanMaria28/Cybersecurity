# OWSAP Top 10 Vulnerabilities

###  A01:2021 Broken Access Control
Logging into someone's account through someone else's credentials.

###  A02:2021 Cryptographic Failures
Cryptographic failures are where attackers often target sensitive data, such as passwords, credit card numbers, and personal information, when you do not properly protect them. This is the root cause of sensitive data exposure.

###  A03:2021 Injection
Injection attacks are a type of cyber-attack where an attacker provides malicious data as input to a program, causing a program execution of a certain command or disclosure of forbidden data. 

###  A04:2021 Insecure Design
It refers to security flaws arising from inadequate or missing security controls in the design and architecture of a software system. 

###  A05:2021 Security Misconfiguration
Security misconfiguration in mobile apps refers to the improper configuration of security settings, permissions, and controls that can lead to vulnerabilities and unauthorized access. 

###  A06:2021 Vulnerable and Outdated Components
refer to the use of third-party libraries, frameworks, or software components that have known security vulnerabilities or are no longer supported by their developers. Attackers can exploit these weaknesses to gain unauthorized access, leading to data breaches, financial losses, and reputational damage. 

###  A07:2021 Identification and Authenticiation Failures
security vulnerabilities related to how applications verify user identities and manage sessions. These failures can lead to unauthorized access to systems and data. Weak passwords, insufficient multi-factor authentication, and session management flaws are common examples of these vulnerabilities. 

###  A08:2021 Software and Data Integrity Failures
They are security vulnerabilities related to how applications verify user identities and manage sessions. These failures can lead to unauthorized access to systems and data. Weak passwords, insufficient multi-factor authentication, and session management flaws are common examples of these vulnerabilities. 

###  A09:2021 Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
These are security vulnerabilities that can occur when a system or application fails to log or monitor security events properly. This can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to systems and data without detection.

###  A10:2021 Server-Side Request Forgery
It is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce a server to make HTTP requests to an arbitrary domain, potentially including internal or restricted resources.
