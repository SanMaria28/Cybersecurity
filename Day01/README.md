# Introduction to Cybersecurity

##  What is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes.

##  Why is Cybersecurity Important?

- Protects sensitive data and personal information
- Safeguards critical infrastructure and services
- Prevents financial losses due to cybercrime
- Ensures business continuity and compliance with regulations
- Builds trust with customers and stakeholders

##  Major Divisions in Cybersecurity Teams

###  Red Team
- Offensive security professionals who simulate real-world attacks.
- Purpose: Identify vulnerabilities before real attackers do.
- Tools: Exploitation frameworks, social engineering, phishing campaigns.

###  Purple Team
- A collaborative team combining Red and Blue team efforts.
- Purpose: Improve communication and effectiveness between offensive and defensive teams.
- Focus: Bridging gaps between attack simulation and defense mechanism.

###  Blue Team
- Defensive security experts focused on protection and monitoring.
- Purpose: Detect, respond to, and recover from cyber threats.
- Tools: SIEM systems, firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), endpoint protection.

##  Types of Cybersecurity Threats

### 1.  Phishing
Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information by pretending to be a trustworthy entity in emails or messages.

### 2.  Ransomware
Malware that encrypts data and demands payment for its release.

### 3.  Malware
Malicious software designed to damage or gain unauthorized access to systems.

### 4.  Social Engineering
Manipulating individuals into divulging confidential information.

### 5.  Man-in-the-Middle Attack
An attacker intercepts and possibly alters communication between two parties.

### 6.  Zero-Day Attack
Exploits a previously unknown vulnerability in software before developers can issue a fix.

## Ethical Hacking

Ethical hacking involves legally breaking into computers and devices to test an organization’s defenses. It is performed by professionals known as "white-hat hackers" with the consent of the organization.

###  Features of Ethical Hacking:
- Performed with legal authorization
- Identifies and fixes security weaknesses
- Enhances the organization's security posture
- Adheres to a code of ethics

##  Types of Hackers

| Type             | Description                                                  |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
|  White Hat     | Ethical hackers who help protect systems                    |
|  Black Hat     | Malicious hackers who exploit vulnerabilities for personal gain |
|  Gray Hat      | Hackers who may violate laws but don’t have malicious intent |
|  Script Kiddies| Inexperienced individuals using existing tools to hack       |
|  Hacktivists    | Hackers promoting political agendas or social change         |

##  Phases of Hacking

1. **Reconnaissance**
   - Gathering preliminary data or intelligence on a target.
   - Tools: Google Dorking, WHOIS, Shodan, etc.

2. **Scanning**
   - Identifying live hosts, open ports, and vulnerabilities.
   - Tools: Nmap, Nessus, OpenVAS.

3. **Gaining Access**
   - Exploiting vulnerabilities to enter the system.
   - Methods: Brute force, SQL injection, phishing.

4. **Maintaining Access**
   - Creating backdoors to retain control over compromised systems.
   - Tools: Rootkits, Trojans, web shells.

5. **Clearing Tracks**
   - Erasing logs and covering footprints to avoid detection.
